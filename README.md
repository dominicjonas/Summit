# Summit

Summit is an app for users to track , display and share their exericse stats. After registering, users are taken to a dashboard that give them an overview of their historical data. Using the side menu users can then navigate to a particular exercise group, where they can fill out their session form to provide our API with the relevant data which is then fed back through the charts. Under each exercise, users are given a detailed exercise log of each session.

## Plan / Workflow

### Idea
The initial idea for Summit came to me in the gym, while entering my current gym stats into the Notes app on my Iphone. I wanted to create a full-stack app that would keep track of my progress of each exercise and display that data in a visually impressive way.
