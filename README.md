## Overview
This was the fourth project during the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembley. We aimed to design and collaboratively build a full-stack app that consumes our own API (as a team of 2 in 21 days).

# Summit

Summit is an app for users to track , display and share their exericse stats. After registering, users are taken to a dashboard that give them an overview of their historical data. Using the side menu users can then navigate to a particular exercise group, where they can fill out their session form to provide our API with the relevant data which is then fed back through the charts. Under each exercise, users are given a detailed exercise log of each session.

## Plan / Workflow

### Idea
The initial idea for Summit came to me in the gym, while entering my current gym stats into the Notes app on my iPhone. I wanted to create a full-stack app that would keep track of my progress of each exercise and display that data in a visually impressive way. 

iPhone Notes.

### Design & Planning

Figma was used for the initial brainstorming, database design, feature planning and UI concepts. Daily meetings were held to talk through the steps needed to reach our MVP and define a clear user-story.

We used Jira to manage our workflow / ticket system and conducted daily meetings to maintain progress and momentum throughout the project.

## Issues
- Given the time frame to complete the project, we were very ambitious with what we wanted this app to achieve. Lessons on priority were learned.
- Getting to grips with Python and Django was a challenge, especially given we had little to no experience working with them at the start of the project. 

## Wins
-  I put a lot of work into refining the UI of this project and getting a consistent theme throughout the styling. The functional and variable driven approach to the SASS files help achieve this.  
- Despite a lot of challenges and setbacks, we managed to produce an intricate level of connection throughout our app. 
- Valuable experience gained in larger scale project management.
- Gathering rich data and using it to drive the experience was our focus from the very beginning. Good communication and planning with our database helped us achieve that.

## Future Features

### Social
- A focus on the social side of the app will be the next feature to implement. 
- Public / Private user data.
- Compare and track your stats and progress among your followers.
- Publish and share progress summits reached across all platforms.  

### D3
- Utilize D3 to produce a deeper and more comprehensive representation of the data recorded for the Cardio section of the app. 

### Focus on Performance and Accessibility 
- App must be fully accessible for all users.
- Squeeze every last FPS from the code.
