# Summit

Summit is an app for users to track , display and share their exericse stats. After registering, users are taken to a dashboard that give them an overview of their historical data. Using the side menu users can then navigate to a particular exercise group, where they can fill out their session form to provide our API with the relevant data which is then fed back through the charts. Under each exercise, users are given a detailed exercise log of each session.

## Plan / Workflow

### Idea
The initial idea for Summit came to me in the gym, while entering my current gym stats into the Notes app on my Iphone. I wanted to create a full-stack app that would keep track of my progress of each exercise and display that data in a visually impressive way.

### Design 

We used Jira to manage our workflow / ticket system and conducted daily meetings to maintain progress and momentum throughout the project.

## Issues
- Given the time frame to complete the project, we were very ambitious with what we wanted this app to acheieve. Lessons on priority were leanred.
- Getting to grips with Python and Django was a challenge, espeicially given we had little to no experience working with them at the start of the project. 

## Wins
